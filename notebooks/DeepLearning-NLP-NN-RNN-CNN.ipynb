       " ' Seed is torture porn no doubt about it But strangely Uwe Boll has written produced and directed more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory Every time watch Boll film feel that some pages of the script must have gone missing There are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue Of course nothing makes much sense either The films are somewhat surreal in this respect SPOILERS Why do the six cops who go to arrest Seed split up and go their separate ways when they get to the darkened residence unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in pairs or by threes Why don the cops ever use their radios How can the bodies decay so quickly process that would normally take many months KNOW it time lapse photography but Seed would never be able to stay on schedule killing people if he always waited around for the previous victim to decay to the point shown How come Seed gets to wear bib overalls and mask while he waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms How can Seed enter maximum security prison stroll around the cell block and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed If nearly people according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie have been murdered why is there only one investigator working on the case Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for Seed at Seed house where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims Didn he think of doing this sooner Why does the police detective go it solo without back up and without even letting dispatch know what he was doing and where he was headed This is particularly frustrating when Boll obviously goes far out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly He spends several screen minutes in setting this up when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least bit more logical END SPOILERS In short the film just sort of serves as framework for few assorted scenes perhaps Boll would think of these as his visions of brutal death by bludgeoning gunshots to the head execution by electrocution and the skinning of live animals raised for their pelts The opening scenes of animals being skinned were indeed unnecessary and disturbing but understand their purpose in the context of the film The centerpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of middle aged woman by Seed using hatchet It obvious that much time was spent on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in Reservoir Dogs though without the Steely Dan soundtrack Is this good movie No Is it worth seeing Only if you are dedicated fan of the torture porn genre or if you are absolutely determined to see sample of torture porn As said at the start of this review even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sickening at points it is truly much more competent than most of Boll movies Perhaps he will continue to improve as filmmaker can only hope that he progresses beyond torture porn and continues more in the vein of Postal ',\n",

       " 'A lot people get hung up on this films tag as children film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults Takashi Miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the children fantasy genre as springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai War The setup is simple boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined What follows is hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of Japanese folklore but wait there also an evil Villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world However the villain here is not mere demon it is the demon spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard Usuing chamber made out of pure liquid hate resentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful Yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals those whove played the video game Sonic The Hedghog might remember certain Dr Robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly who Sonic had to then liberate The hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in world gone suddenly mad Though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the Yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans of course in this magical world of Miike Yokai war even beans take magical power when one believes in them In several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and desire to party The Yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of Earth for great Yokai festival and even then only to dance and party Also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all well that ends well fantasy ending but with final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the Yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being spirit can never really die This ending with it Yokai spirit who is the spitting image of Pokemon Pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of over consumption The villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them in Japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformed This is one of the first scripts Miike has contributed to and believe it shows as there a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness Though ve focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off do want to say that visually it a kaleidescope of CGI stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well There a dreamlike quality to lot of the film and the Miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either The Yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who believe even kill few humans deformed aborted calf with mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of young scantily clad water spirit as boy seem to linger bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is children film However these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad Grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more often All and all this is one of Miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performances the Yokai spirits have humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth The latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood Another beautiful funny and truly original film from thrilling director who hasn come close to his apex Instant classic ',\n",

       " 'Sigh sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such grudge against director Michael Winner Surely he isn the avatar of subtlety as his films are practically always hard handed and confronting but so what They re awesomely entertaining His most famous action movies like the first three entries in the Death Wish series for example are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns but even when Winner takes on far more mature cinema genres like the religious horrors of The Sentinel for example he doesn stand chance with any of the critics The Sentinel generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release when it leaked that Michael Winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth Pretty much the exact same controversy caused Todd Browning masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema Freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years And why Just because certain prudish and easily offended people who shouldn watch the movie in the first place claim it an unethical thing to do don suppose Michael Winner or Todd Browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place Another major reason why critics didn warmly welcome The Sentinel is because Jeffrey Konvitz novel and thus Michael Winner screenplay is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus according to the merciless pens of horror critics little more than pure plagiarism Admittedly The Sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from Rosemary Baby The Omen and The Exorcist but let face it cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories If you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and in all fairness handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots The Sentinel honestly still remains uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you re not likely to forget easy Alison Parker ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas moves into stunning brownstone apartment in Brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend Michael who proposed to wed her several times already Alison physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery She meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats even though the landlady claims she and blind priest are the only tenants She frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide It slowly becomes clear that Alison got chosen to serve higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this It truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the DVD immediately reveal that Alison brownstone apartment is the earth gateway to hell itself and she the chosen one to guard it because the film script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation For nearly minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences Michael Winner successfully maintains the impression that Alison own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the Catholic Church and her fianc s odd behavior are strictly red herrings Multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like Alison flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs The whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above is literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting denouements ever witnessed The cast Michael Winner managed to gather is deeply impressive especially considering The Sentinel still remains legitimate horror movie and this genre isn the most popular among prominent actors but of course you also have to put the cast listing little into perspective With such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos Martin Balsam and John Carradine for example only appear on screen for couple of minutes all together Several others like Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum Beverly Angelo and Tom Berenger perhaps add lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers My personal pick for best performances go to Burgess Meredith as the uncanny neighbor and Eli Wallach as the satirical police inspector The relatively unknown Cristina Raines does an admirable job carrying the film and Chris Sarandon neatly back her up even though he sports ridiculous mustache In my humble opinion The Sentinel is marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely must see for TRUE genre fanatics

player who can blow the horn so good that you think Gabriel is blowing horn in the sky The sexy hot female dancer Consuela Harris would put Ann Miller and Gyspy Rose Lee to shame Adding further info Popular blues singer of the and Cora Green is the focus of the film she Mandy good hard working woman with no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women nosy neighbor played by Amanda Randolph tells Mandy what she seen and heard and Mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of Eloise played Hazel Diaz Hot Cha entertainer in the and fight breaks out Then Mandy goes to Harlem where she reunites with somewhat guardian angel Lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies Dorothy Van Engle Lena provides Mandy with home job and helps her become star when temperamental Cora Smith played by Hazel guess she playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior When Cora gets drunk and breaks her leg Lena convinces everyone that Mandy is right for the job and Lena is right and star is born in Mandy Tall long lanky but handsome Carman Newsome is the cool aspiring producer who Lena looks out for as well Pretty boy Larry Seymour plays the no good man but after Lena threatens him he might shape up There are few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where Cora Smith Hazel Diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that not enough she almost gets into fight with Mandy again In between there great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing There even white people watching the entertainment wonder where Micheaux found them there even scene where there blacks and whites sitting together at the club Micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such bold move This movie was the first race film really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to Oscar Micheaux This movie is one of the best of the race film genre its behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business No these early race films may not be the best can be compared with Hallelujah Green Pastures Stormy Weather Cabin In The Sky Carmen Jones or any other Hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide glimpse into black life and black entertainment through black person eyes These films gave blacks chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in Hollywood Most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time Micheaux and Spencer Williams couldn afford Nina Mae McKinney Josephine Baker Ethel Waters Fredi Washington Paul Robeson Rex Ingram and more of the bigger stars so Micheaux and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some weren great actors and actresses but think Micheaux and others knew most weren good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films For some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didn want to play Hollywood stereotypes so think you ll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers These race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films aren the greatest example of cinema but even Hollywood films didn start out great in the beginning think if the race film genre continued it would have better If your looking for great acting most race films aren the ones but if your looking for real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films There are some entertaining race films with good acting cast Moon Over Harlem Body and Soul Paradise In Harlem Keep Punching Sunday Sinners Dark Manhattan Broken Strings Boy What Girl Mystery In Swing Miracle In Harlem and Sepia Cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting ',\n",

remains of bat like race of creatures three perfect looking humanoids two men Chris Jagger Bill Malin beautiful woman Mathilda May all of whom they take aboard the Churchill Thirty days later back on Earth the Churchill is detected on radar rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out all the crew supposedly dead The rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though take them back to Earth where in space research center in London they come back to life start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout London This English production was produced by the notorious Menahem Golan Yoram Globus who during the early were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company Cannon usually starring Chuck Norris they wanted to move into the big time signed director Tobe Hooper up on three film deal which were this Lifeforce the Invaders from Mars remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel to Hooper own classic all of which flopped basically bankrupt both Golan Globus Cannon was no more Anyway despite being commercial flop at the box office have to say think Lifeforce is highly enjoyable if rather silly sci fi horror When originally released into theatres back in Lifefore was cut down to minutes by Golan Globus but over the past few years the longer minute cut has all but replaced it on DVD VHS Laserdisc TV although apparently Hooper original cut of the film ran for minutes so there even more footage out there somewhere will be basing my comments on the longer minute cut the script by Dan Bannon Don Jakoby uncredited rewrites by Michael Armstrong Olaf Pooley was based on the novel The Space Vampires by Colin Wilson has many extraordinary ideas it scope is truly ambitious one felt that it ends up being bit of mess but hell of an entertaining one It moves along like rocket at heart there a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into tangle There are also some hilarious moments in Lifeforce the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female Vampire to surrender by offering her half eaten biscuit is true camp classic the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where Railsback ends up kissing Patrick Stewart many many more besides don know call me weird but just thought Lifeforce was tremendous fun highly entertaining in just about every way from silly character odd dialogue strange ideas that never quite come together some terrific visuals Lifeforce certainly isn a film that will bore you Director Hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has double what he had for Poltergeist even he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen John Dykstra the guy responsible for Star Wars Star Trek The Motion Picture more recently Spider Man was brought in to handle the visual effects generally speaking they look fabulous The sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great there also some really good visual effects back on Earth including the destruction of London as of blue souls fly around everywhere There some nudity but not much gore there are some withered corpses few gunshot wounds the skin on someones hand peels off blood spurts from someones eyes nose ears there a severed arm as well as some zombies The special make up effects are also generally very good wouldn say Lifeforce is scary as such as it more of sci fi film than horror loved the way Hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness that there is no solid floor as it were With supposed budget of about it made less than half that in it theatrical run hasn set the world alight on video or DVD either which is shame because although it a bit of mess it very enjoyable to watch Shot on location in England Well filmed in widescreen the cropped image is horrible cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it hard to make out what going on the sense of the vastness of space the alien spaceship is lost The acting is OK in very silly film Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski while Anthony Hopkins turned the role of Caine down Lifeforce is bizarre film no two ways about it really anyone looking for something simple straight forward should look elsewhere Anyone looking for something bit different in the sci fi genre than give Lifeforce go as it one of those so bad it good films with some impressive effects it isn your average run of the mill film by any means ',\n",

which comes as double edged sword On one hand who better to translate the play than the original writer On the other hand who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself Doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense with frustrating ending unnecessary dialogue questionable directing and of course the inability to provide substantial answers It is growing trend among these high caliber films to not answer all questions it provides and this has to stop Doubt is like joke without its punch line like book with the final pages missing like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of hotly contested football game and like not having the cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next Doubt just like the previous Best Picture frustrationfest No Country For Old Men doesn really end it doesn provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending Yes that was the intent but this isn a test of humanity it a cop out do not pay money to see an unfinished work pay money to see beginning middle and end and pray that don fall asleep during the three acts We are forced to become the writers of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other This little drama is about nun Meryl Streep who seems very sure that the well beloved priest Philip Seymour Hoffman is making sexual advances towards child that goes to the church the first African American boy in the Catholic church The church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone backs The plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently which attracts the notice of young teacher Amy Adams The story is set right after the assassination of John Kennedy which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other Doubt strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over Streep seems to be Oscar worthy in every role she in and here she is no different as her sternness and cold hearted behavior places blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church Hoffman excels yet again as the priest by successfully meshing suspicion with charming personality and friendly aura The seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time but Hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers When these two argue you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched But let not forget Amy Adams Enchanted and Viola Davis Law ad Order for their superb job either Doubt casting ensemble is among the best in Yet like previously stated it the writing and directing that ruins this film especially when dwindling down the third act Questions pop up but they aren answered Characters pop up but provide no real enhancement towards the plot Kids behave different but we never truly find out why There are awkward angles in the camera work and there no actual reason why John Patrick Shanley the writer of the play had one previous film in his
